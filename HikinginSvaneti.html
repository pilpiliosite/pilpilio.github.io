        <h2>{{page.title}}</h2>
        <p>Preserved by its long isolation and inaccessibility, the Svaneti region is an exceptional combination of breathtaking mountain scenery with beautiful medieval-type villages and tower-houses. The entire area is a part of UNESCO Cultural Heritage. Hiking is an amazing way to discovering this region, with its unforgettable landscapes, magical waterfalls and snow-topped mountain peaks and exploration of its ethnographic wonders.</p>
